# Server-Details-Mini-Project
***This project gives a detailed information about the server like who is the user, date and time, Server Uptime, last login activities, Disk utilization, RAM utilization and Top CPU Processes Running. Some extra commands are used just to beautify the project. This project is made using Shell-Scripting, I've also taken a backup of this script in a zip file.***
